# SafeSignal
Team: TeamTeam's entry to the TomTom.NeXt Hackathon

SafeSignal is a fast and easy method for groups of motorcyclist to communicate.
Simple gestures will trigger alarm/popus on the devices of your groupmates.

We created this prototype in the platform UNITY to demonstrate how the features would be implemented in the TomTom app.
