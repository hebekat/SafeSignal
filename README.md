# SafeSignal
Team "TeamTeam" 's entry to the [TomTom.NeXt Hackathon](https://www.tomtom.com/careers/global-student-hackathon/)

SafeSignal is a fast and easy method for groups of motorcyclist to communicate.
Simple gestures will trigger alarms in case of danger or warnings on the devices of your groupmates.
There's also an eye to the travel entertainement with the possibility to suggest alternative routes to your group and also to disable this feature for safety and more map visibility

We created this prototype in the UnityEngine in C# to demonstrate how the features would be implemented in the final app.

To see the implementation of the prototype's functionalities see the *.cs files.

## SafeSignal won the 3rd place!
