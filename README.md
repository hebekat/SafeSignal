# SafeSignal
## TeamTeam's entry to the [TomTom n.EXT Hackathon](https://www.tomtom.com/careers/global-student-hackathon/)

**SafeSignal** is a **fast and easy** method for groups of motorcyclist to communicate.
Simple gestures will prompt your groupmates with a danger alert or warning, or some travel related information.
There's also an eye to the **entertainement** with the possibility to **suggest alternative routes** to your group and also to disable this feature for **safety** and **more map visibility**

We created this prototype in the **UnityEngine** in **C#** to demonstrate how the features would be implemented in the final app.

To see the implementation of the prototype's functionalities see the '.cs' files.

## SafeSignal won the 3rd place!
